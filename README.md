# OCR API ü§ñ

## Instructions

- Fork and clone [this repository](https://github.com/JoinCODED/Task-Express-M4-OCR/) to your `Development` folder.

In this task, you will create a cool api that takes an image and returns the text inside. Aka OCR, Image to Text.

### Morgan Setup

1. Install [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan)

```shell
$ npm install morgan
```
2. In `app.js`, create a variable called morgan.
3. Configure your express application to use morgan using the `dev` format.


### Cors

1. Install [cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors)

```shell
$ npm install cors
```
2. In `app.js`, create a variable called cors.
3. Enable your app to use the cors middleware.

### Setup Media Folder

Create a route for the media files.

1. Create a folder called `media` for your images.
2. In `app.js`, create a route with the path `/media`.
3. Join `media` to the directory path `__dirname` using `join` and pass it to `express.static`.
4. Test your route by putting any image in the `media` folder, then in your browser go to `localhost:8000/media/<image_name>`.
5. Add `media` to your `.gitignore` file.

### Setup Upload Middleware

Set up the upload middleware using multer.

1. Install multer

```shell
$ npm install multer
```

2. In your `middleware` folder (create one if you don't have it), create a file called `multer.js`.

3. In this file `multer.js`, copy paste the following code:

```js
const multer = require('multer');

const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: './media',
  filename: (req, file, cb) => {
    cb(null, `${+new Date()}${file.originalname}`);
  },
});

const upload = multer({
  storage,
});

module.exports = upload;
```

4. In `ocr/ocr.routes.js`, require `upload`.

```js
const upload = require('../../middleware/multer');
```

5. Call `upload` middleware before the `ocrCreate` controller.

6. Specify that `single` images are uploaded only and the field name is `image`.

### Uploading Images

1. In `ocrCreate` controller method, check if an image was uploaded by checking if `req.file` exists.
2. If a file is uploaded, save the path in the body of the URL.
3. The path must include the request's protocol `http` and the host `req.get("host")` followed by `media` and the file's name.

## The rest is a challenge!

### OCR!

1. Install the following [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tesseract.js/v/2.1.1) and read the [docs](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js) on its implementation
2. In your `ocr.controllers`, use the package to receive an image that contains some text, and return the contents of that image in a json object.

### üçã Multer Size Limit

In `multer.js` specify a size limit of 1 megabyte for the files uploaded.

### ü§º‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Multer File Filter

In `multer.js` specify a the file types which are allowed to upload, we need to only upload images!

### üå∂ Back To React

Create a front end page for your ocr api!
